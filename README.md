# Project Description: Pathfinding Visualization with BFS, DFS, and A* Algorithms

## Introduction:
The Pathfinding Visualization project is an interactive tool designed to demonstrate three popular pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* (A-star). The project aims to provide a visually engaging platform that allows users to understand how these algorithms work and compare their efficiency in finding the shortest path between two points on a grid-based map.

## Features:

### Interactive Grid:
The project will present users with a grid-based map, where they can define obstacles, start position, and target position. Users can interactively draw or erase obstacles to simulate different scenarios.

### BFS Algorithm Visualization:
When the user selects the BFS algorithm, the program will animate the exploration of nodes in a breadth-first manner. Users will be able to observe the step-by-step process as BFS searches for the shortest path.

### DFS Algorithm Visualization:
Similarly, when the user selects the DFS algorithm, the program will visually demonstrate the depth-first exploration of nodes. Users can witness the differences between DFS and BFS in terms of pathfinding strategies.

### A* Algorithm Visualization:
The project will showcase the A* algorithm, which uses heuristics to find the most promising path first. Users can observe the A* algorithm's efficiency compared to BFS and DFS, as it should generally find the shortest path faster.
